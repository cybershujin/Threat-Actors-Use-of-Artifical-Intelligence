# Threat Actors Use of Artificial Intelligence

This github is an attempt to organize known use of artificial intelligence by cyber threat actors and to map and track those techniques.
In this scenario we are focusing on cyber threat attacks that are being faciliated in some way by threat actors using artifical intelligence. This does not include political influence campaigns or mis/dis/mal information campaigns. It does include some fraud related cases, but I attempt to keep the focus on fraud activities that we would see in traditional campaigns but enhanced with AI.

This is *not* for:

•	Threat actors attacking AI / ML / LLMs

•	Researchers attacking or finding exploits or possible uses AI by threat actors

•	Mis/dis/mal information campaigns using Deepfake technology

•	Threats to AI users, or AI researchers
