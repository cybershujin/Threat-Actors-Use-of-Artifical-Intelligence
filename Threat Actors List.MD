# Threat Actors List

Note that these are taken from reports listed on the [main page](https://github.com/cybershujin/Threat-Actors-Use-of-Artifical-Intelligence/tree/main) but the TTP mapping is an effort by me to map to the closest possible MITRE ATT&CK technique used. If you find an entry and believe a better TTP mapping is available, please contact me and/or comment.

| Fancy Bear | Forest Blizzard, APT28, Strontium |  APT28 is a Russian military intelligence actor linked to GRU Unit 26165, who has targeted victims of both tactical and strategic interest to the Russian government. Microsoft assesses that Forest Blizzard operations play a significant supporting role to Russia’s foreign policy and military objectives both in Ukraine and in the broader international community. Forest Blizzard’s use of LLMs has involved research into various satellite and radar technologies that may pertain to conventional military operations in Ukraine, as well as generic research aimed at supporting their cyber operations | **LLM-informed reconnaissance** <br> T1592 - Gather Victim Org Information <br><br> **LLM-enhanced scripting techniques** <br> T1588 - Develop Capabilities: Tool | [APT28 aka Fancy Bear](https://github.com/cybershujin/Threat-Actors-Use-of-Artifical-Intelligence/blob/main/APT28.MD)|
| Lazarus | APT43, Emerald Sleet, Velvet Chollima, Kimsuky, TA406, Thallium | North Korean threat actor with recent operations relied on spear-phishing emails to compromise and gather intelligence from prominent individuals with expertise on North Korea. Microsoft observed Emerald Sleet impersonating reputable academic institutions and NGOs to lure victims into replying with expert insights and commentary about foreign policies related to North Korea. Emerald Sleet’s use of LLMs has been in support of this activity and involved research into think tanks and experts on North Korea, as well as the generation of content likely to be used in spear-phishing campaigns. Emerald Sleet also interacted with LLMs to understand publicly known vulnerabilities, to troubleshoot technical issues, and for assistance with using various web technologies. | **LLM-assisted vulnerability research** <br> T1588.006 Obtain Capabilities: Vulnerabilities <br><br> **LLM-enhanced scripting techniques** <br>T1588 - Develop Capabilities: Tool <br><br> **LLM-supported social engineering** <br>T1566 - Phishing <br><br> **LLM-informed reconnaissance** <br>T1592 - Gather Victim Org Information | link coming soon|
| Imperial Kitten | Crimson Sandstorm, Yellowliderc, Tortoiseshell | Iranian threat actor assessed to be connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). This actor has targeted multiple sectors, including defense, maritime shipping, transportation, healthcare, and technology. These operations have frequently relied on watering hole attacks and social engineering to deliver custom .NET malware. Prior research also identified custom Crimson Sandstorm malware using email-based command-and-control (C2) channels. The use of LLMs by Crimson Sandstorm has reflected the broader behaviors that the security community has observed from this threat actor. Interactions have involved requests for support around social engineering, assistance in troubleshooting errors, .NET development, and ways in which an attacker might evade detection when on a compromised machine. | **LLM-supported social engineering** <br>T1566 - Phishing <br><br> **LLM-enhanced scripting techniques** <br>T1588 - Develop Capabilities: Tool <br><br> **LLM-enhanced anomaly detection evasion** <br> T1562.001 - Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools |  link coming soon|
| Aquatic Panda | Charcoal Typhoon, ControlX, RedHotel, Bronze University, Red Scully, Chromium | Chinese state-affiliated threat actor with a broad operational scope. Activities have predominantly focused on entities within Taiwan, Thailand, Mongolia, Malaysia, France, and Nepal, with observed interests extending to institutions and individuals globally who oppose China’s policies. In recent operations, this actor group has been observed interacting with LLMs in ways that suggest a limited exploration of how LLMs can augment their technical operations. This has consisted of using LLMs to support tooling development, scripting, understanding various commodity cybersecurity tools, and for generating content that could be used to social engineer targets. | **LLM-informed reconnaissance** <br>T1588.006 Obtain Capabilities: Vulnerabilities <br><br> **LLM-enhanced scripting techniques** <br>T1588 - Develop Capabilities: Tool <br><br> **LLM-refined operational command techniques** <br>TA0003 - Persistence and TA004 Privilege Escalation |  link coming soon|
