# Threat Actors List

This github is an attempt to organize known use of artificial intelligence by cyber threat actors and to map and track those techniques. In this scenario we are focusing on cyber threat attacks that are being faciliated in some way by threat actors using artifical intelligence. This does not include political influence campaigns or mis/dis/mal information campaigns. It does include some fraud related cases, but I attempt to keep the focus on fraud activities that we would see in traditional campaigns but enhanced with AI.

This is not for:

• Threat actors attacking AI / ML / LLMs

• Researchers attacking or finding exploits or possible uses AI by threat actors

• Mis/dis/mal information campaigns using Deepfake technology

• Threats to AI users, or AI researchers

Notes:

**UnSub or Multiple UnSub - (sourcename)** used to refer to unnamed subjects, or multiple unnamed subjects mentioned in reports

These these are taken from reports listed on the [Sources page](https://github.com/cybershujin/Threat-Actors-Use-of-Artifical-Intelligence/blob/main/Sources.md) but the TTP mapping is an effort by me to map to the closest possible MITRE ATT&CK technique used. If you find an entry and believe a better TTP mapping is available, please contact me and/or comment.

| Fancy Bear | Forest Blizzard, APT28, Strontium |  APT28 is a Russian military intelligence actor linked to GRU Unit 26165, who has targeted victims of both tactical and strategic interest to the Russian government. Microsoft assesses that Forest Blizzard operations play a significant supporting role to Russia’s foreign policy and military objectives both in Ukraine and in the broader international community. Forest Blizzard’s use of LLMs has involved research into various satellite and radar technologies that may pertain to conventional military operations in Ukraine, as well as generic research aimed at supporting their cyber operations.

| Lazarus | APT43, Emerald Sleet, Velvet Chollima, Kimsuky, TA406, Thallium | North Korean threat actor with recent operations relied on spear-phishing emails to compromise and gather intelligence from prominent individuals with expertise on North Korea. Microsoft observed Emerald Sleet impersonating reputable academic institutions and NGOs to lure victims into replying with expert insights and commentary about foreign policies related to North Korea. Emerald Sleet’s use of LLMs has been in support of this activity and involved research into think tanks and experts on North Korea, as well as the generation of content likely to be used in spear-phishing campaigns. Emerald Sleet also interacted with LLMs to understand publicly known vulnerabilities, to troubleshoot technical issues, and for assistance with using various web technologies.

| Imperial Kitten | Crimson Sandstorm, Yellowliderc, Tortoiseshell | Iranian threat actor assessed to be connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). This actor has targeted multiple sectors, including defense, maritime shipping, transportation, healthcare, and technology. These operations have frequently relied on watering hole attacks and social engineering to deliver custom .NET malware. Prior research also identified custom Crimson Sandstorm malware using email-based command-and-control (C2) channels. The use of LLMs by Crimson Sandstorm has reflected the broader behaviors that the security community has observed from this threat actor. Interactions have involved requests for support around social engineering, assistance in troubleshooting errors, .NET development, and ways in which an attacker might evade detection when on a compromised machine.

| Aquatic Panda | Charcoal Typhoon, ControlX, RedHotel, Bronze University, Red Scully, Chromium | Chinese state-affiliated threat actor with a broad operational scope. Activities have predominantly focused on entities within Taiwan, Thailand, Mongolia, Malaysia, France, and Nepal, with observed interests extending to institutions and individuals globally who oppose China’s policies. In recent operations, this actor group has been observed interacting with LLMs in ways that suggest a limited exploration of how LLMs can augment their technical operations. This has consisted of using LLMs to support tooling development, scripting, understanding various commodity cybersecurity tools, and for generating content that could be used to social engineer targets.

| Sodium | Salmon Typhoon, Samurai Panda, Maverick Panda, APT4 | Sophisticated Chinese state-affiliated threat actor with a history of targeting US defense contractors, government agencies, and entities within the cryptographic technology sector.  This threat actor has demonstrated its capabilities through the deployment of malware, such as Win32/Wkysol, to maintain remote access to compromised systems. With over a decade of operations marked by intermittent periods of dormancy and resurgence. (Sodium's) interactions with LLMs throughout 2023 appear exploratory and suggest that this threat actor is evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in sourcing information on potentially sensitive topics, high profile individuals, regional geopolitics, US influence, and internal affairs. This tentative engagement with LLMs could reflect both a broadening of their intelligence-gathering toolkit and an experimental phase in assessing the capabilities of emerging technologies.

| Unsub1 - Kaspersky | N/A | Using fake sites, they hosted “GPT chats” supposedly capable of diagnosing computer problems, making money and such. In fact, the site deployed no AI models, but only used the topic to stir interest with potential victims and make a bigger killing. One such page mimicking the Microsoft website warned visitors that their computer was infected with a Trojan. To avoid losing data, they were advised not to reboot or turn off the device until the issue was resolved. Two options were offered: call a hotline or chat with Lucy, an AI chatbot. In the second case, you had to choose a method of diagnosing the device, after which the bot said it was unable to solve the problem and recommended calling support. Naturally, professional scammers, not Microsoft engineers, were waiting at the other end of the line. *Analyst note: This sounds like [Bazacall](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/07/29/bazacall-phony-call-centers-lead-to-exfiltration-and-ransomware/) like activity* [Source](https://securelist.com/spam-phishing-report-2023/112015/) | **Lookalike LLM** <br> T1583 Acquire Infrastructure | N/A |
| Unsub2 - Kaspersky | N/A | “Smart chatbots” were also used as “consultants” on making money online. On one site a bot pretending to be an Elon Musk design advertised investment services. After telling the new “client” that it could make them rich quickly, the robot asked about their education, income level, and investment experience. Regardless of the answers, the bot informed the client that it would do all the earning. Next, it demonstrated an amount it could offer and prompted the user to register simply by providing their contact details. Events then likely unfolded as in other similar schemes: The “AI” asked for a small fee in recognition of its intellectual abilities, and then simply vanished into the ether.
