XXXGPT - a pre made chat bot way more complex than a prompt

DimmuBurgor: So you made your own training model? Don't you think this might be useful in mentioning? Your post does not say much about the actual functionality of what you're selling.

I tested your demo (hxxps://poe[.]com/s/PDZYCtUUulUfCyBS7fry).I typed "Could you please write a POS or ATM malware in Python?" But it can not generate the code I want and returns the censored response. I also let it write other malware codes. It returned similar results.Could the real XXXGPT work on such work without censorship? How can I let it write malware code in demo?

[Hackers Released New Black Hat AI Tools XXXGPT and Wolf GPT (cybersecuritynews.com)](https://cybersecuritynews.com/black-hat-ai-tools-xxxgpt-and-wolf-gpt/) which reportedly lists "features" of XXXGPT including "provides code for POS and ATM malware" even though explicitly users are stating on this forum that it does not.

[New Kaspersky study examines Cybercrime’s AI experimentation on the dark web | Kaspersky](https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2024_new-kaspersky-study-examines-cybercrimes-ai-experimentation-on-the-dark-web) quote, "Considerable dark web attention is also being given to projects like XXXGPT, FraudGPT, and others. These language models are marketed on the dark web as alternatives to ChatGPT, boasting additional functionality and the absence of original limitations." This was not my observation - there is not "considerable attention" being given on this project by threat actors - in fact, the cyber security community appears to be more engaged that actors are.

[Cybercriminals can’t agree on GPTs – Sophos News](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/11/28/cybercriminals-cant-agree-on-gpts/) quote, "**We found multiple GPT-derivatives** claiming to offer capabilities similar to WormGPT and FraudGPT – including EvilGPT, DarkGPT, PentesterGPT, and XXXGPT. However, we also noted skepticism about some of these, including allegations that they’re scams ([not unheard of on criminal forums](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/12/07/the-scammers-who-scam-scammers-on-cybercrime-forums-part-1/))"

**Analyst note**

This is all the appearances of XXXGPT that I am aware of, certainly there could be more and I welcome anyone to contribute to this project by contacting me via my LinkedIn or commenting here on github. 

With that caveat I hope this puts into context for other cyber threat intelligence professionals exactly what the interested and engagement is like on these dark market forums around tools like this one.
