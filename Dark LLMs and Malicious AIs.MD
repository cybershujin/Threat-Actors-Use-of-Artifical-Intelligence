#Dark LLMs aka BlackHat GPTs and Malicious AIs

While most LLMs/AIs have ethical guardrails that would require a [jailbreak](https://zvelo.com/how-ai-jailbreaks-pave-the-way-for-unskilled-attackers/) to bypass those built-in limitations, there are some AIs and LLMs that are not designed with those limitations.
These Dark LLMs and Malicious AIs are intended to be weaponized for cyberattacks.

[Zvelo](https://zvelo.com/malicious-ai-the-rise-of-dark-llms/) had a article on the topic recently, noting, "Dark LLMs are AI-powered tools that leverage OpenAI’s API to engineer malicious variations of ChatGPT that operate without any sort of ethical guidelines or built-in limitations. Tailor made for the vast cybercriminal networks, the main goal of the dark LLMs is to facilitate nefarious activities. At this point, they have primarily been observed being utilized to generate malicious code, exploit vulnerabilities, and create targeted spear-phishing emails."

|XXXGPT| [Link](https://twitter.com/FalconFeedsio/status/1685915834718269440/photo/1) | XXXGPT is a malicious iteration of ChatGPT, engineered for illicit activities. The tool claims to offer a broad spectrum of functions to facilitate various types of cyberattacks including botnets for large-scale attacks, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), Crypters, and malware creation. Notably, it excels in producing hard-to-detect malware, thanks to its convincing nature and an advanced obfuscation feature. This obfuscation capability significantly enhances its ability to camouflage the code it generates, making the malware challenging to identify and thwart, thereby adding a complex layer to cybersecurity defense strategies. |
|Wolf GPT | [Link](link)| Wolf GPT, a malicious variant of ChatGPT, harnesses Python programming to craft cryptographic malware from extensive datasets of existing malicious software. Distinguished by its ability to enhance attacker anonymity within specific attack vectors, it also facilitates advanced phishing campaigns. Similar to XXXGPT, Wolf GPT possesses an obfuscation feature that considerably hampers cybersecurity teams’ efforts to detect and mitigate these sophisticated threats. |
