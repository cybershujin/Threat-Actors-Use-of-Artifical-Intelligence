#Dark LLMs aka BlackHat GPTs and Malicious AIs

While most LLMs/AIs have ethical guardrails that would require a [jailbreak](https://zvelo.com/how-ai-jailbreaks-pave-the-way-for-unskilled-attackers/) to bypass those built-in limitations, there are some AIs and LLMs that are not designed with those limitations.
These Dark LLMs and Malicious AIs are intended to be weaponized for cyberattacks.

(Zvelo)[https://zvelo.com/malicious-ai-the-rise-of-dark-llms/] had a article on the topic recently, noting, "Dark LLMs are AI-powered tools that leverage OpenAIâ€™s API to engineer malicious variations of ChatGPT that operate without any sort of ethical guidelines or built-in limitations. Tailor made for the vast cybercriminal networks, the main goal of the dark LLMs is to facilitate nefarious activities. At this point, they have primarily been observed being utilized to generate malicious code, exploit vulnerabilities, and create targeted spear-phishing emails."
