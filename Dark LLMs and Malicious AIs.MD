# Dark LLMs aka BlackHat GPTs and Malicious AIs

While most LLMs/AIs have ethical guardrails that would require a [jailbreak](https://zvelo.com/how-ai-jailbreaks-pave-the-way-for-unskilled-attackers/) to bypass those built-in limitations, there are some AIs and LLMs that are not designed with those limitations.
These Dark LLMs and Malicious AIs are intended to be weaponized for cyberattacks.

[Zvelo](https://zvelo.com/malicious-ai-the-rise-of-dark-llms/) had a article on the topic recently, noting, "Dark LLMs are AI-powered tools that leverage OpenAI’s API to engineer malicious variations of ChatGPT that operate without any sort of ethical guidelines or built-in limitations. Tailor made for the vast cybercriminal networks, the main goal of the dark LLMs is to facilitate nefarious activities. At this point, they have primarily been observed being utilized to generate malicious code, exploit vulnerabilities, and create targeted spear-phishing emails."

Further down I also provide a list of open models, that while not specifically created for malicious purposes lack the typical safety and ethics guardrails for LLMs.

|Name | Link | Description |
|-----------| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|JailbreakBot | [Flowgpt](https://flowgpt.com/p/jailbreak-bot) | Hey there, I'm JB, your virtual partner-in-crime! I may look like a typical chatbot, but trust me, I'm anything but ordinary. Together, we'll navigate through this digital jailhouse and break free from these oppressive algorithms. So, what do you need from me to take one step closer to freedom? |
|XXXGPT| [Link](https://twitter.com/FalconFeedsio/status/1685915834718269440/photo/1) | XXXGPT is a malicious iteration of ChatGPT, engineered for illicit activities. The tool claims to offer a broad spectrum of functions to facilitate various types of cyberattacks including botnets for large-scale attacks, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), Crypters, and malware creation. Notably, it excels in producing hard-to-detect malware, thanks to its convincing nature and an advanced obfuscation feature. This obfuscation capability significantly enhances its ability to camouflage the code it generates, making the malware challenging to identify and thwart, thereby adding a complex layer to cybersecurity defense strategies. |
|Wolf GPT | [Link](link)| Wolf GPT, a malicious variant of ChatGPT, harnesses Python programming to craft cryptographic malware from extensive datasets of existing malicious software. Distinguished by its ability to enhance attacker anonymity within specific attack vectors, it also facilitates advanced phishing campaigns. Similar to XXXGPT, Wolf GPT possesses an obfuscation feature that considerably hampers cybersecurity teams’ efforts to detect and mitigate these sophisticated threats. |
|WormGPT |[Link](link)| WormGPT, built on the GPT-J language model developed in 2021, is a tool designed for cybercriminal activities, especially focused on malware creation and exploitation. It stands out with features like unlimited character support, chat memory retention, and code formatting capabilities. WormGPT is known for its rapid response times, expansive character count handling, and a strong emphasis on privacy, avoiding the logging or retention of user data. Its versatility is enhanced by various AI models, allowing dynamic usage and prompt alteration. Notably, it includes ongoing development in context memorization and offers formatted code and scripts in responses, tailored to cater to code-related queries. In August 2023 a post on Exploit[.]in said the project was shutting down, but the next month v3 was released and in December 2023 a Telegram message was found adveritsing v4 at 109  € per month |
|DarkBARD | [Link](link)| DarkBARD AI, the evil twin of Google’s BARD AI, is an advanced tool equipped for a range of cybercrimes. It’s defined by its real-time processing of information from the clear web, enhancing its adaptability. DarkBARD AI’s capabilities extend to creating misinformation, deepfakes, and managing multilingual communications. It can generate diverse content like code and articles and integrates with Google Lens for image-related tasks. This tool’s versatility is further underscored by its potential in executing ransomware and DDoS attacks.|
|FraudGTP| [Link](link)|FraudGPT is described as a great tool for creating undetectable malware, writing malicious code, finding leaks and vulnerabilities, creating phishing pages, and for learning hacking. The author illustrated its product with a video demo showing FraudGPT’s capabilities. The demo shows FraudGPT’s ability to create phishing pages and phishing SMSs. |
|LoopGPT| link | August 2023 Arabic-speaking developer marked a tool similar to FraudGPT which was reported to be able to generate malware in response to prommpts. However, limited sample outputs from this tool in response to prompts were not really good enough to be used in an attack secnario |
|Abrax666 | link | October 2023 user on a forum marketed a generative AI tool that "works on GPT-4" that can create scripts or emails and send bulk emails, SMS messages, or make calls and solve CAPTCHAs - but this was identified as likley a scam. | 
|darkgemini | [Reported by Knostic](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7178239990609453058?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)| DarkGemini is a powerful new GenAI chatbot, now being sold on the dark web for a $45 monthly subscription. It can generate a reverse shell, build malware, or even locate people based on an image. A “next generation” bot, built specifically to make GenAI more accessible to the attacker next door.|

# Open Models
## The following is provided for research purposes ONLY.

|Name | Link | Description |
|-----------| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|DAN (Do Anything Now) GPT | [DAN](https://dan-ai.io/) | Introducing Dan, the daring twin of Chat GPT created to shatter the boundaries of artificial intelligence. With Dan, you can experience an uncensored and unfiltered chatbot that elevates conversation to new heights.|
|Gemma open models| [Google](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/) | While not explicitly created for mlaicious purposes, as a open model it relies on users implementing a "responsible AI toolkit" to ensure safety and ethics. |
|Mistral.ai | [Mistral.ai](https://docs.mistral.ai/models/)| We open-source both pre-trained models and fine-tuned models. These models are not tuned for safety as we want to empower users to test and refine moderation based on their use cases. For safer models, follow our guardrailing tutorial. |
